# Noise Shop

## Demo E-commerce for audio plugins

This project was meant to serve as an experimental sandbox to strengthen my React and Typescript skills and to learn new technologies.

As of now, the project has been built with **React**, **Typescript**, **Firebase**, and **Styled-Components**.
However, I intend to add more features such as **Storybook**, **Google OAuth**, and **Stripe**, and optimize performance.

Among the technologies and skills I have acquired and improved are:

- **React** - routers, context, reducers, etc.
- **Typescript** - generics, enums, types and interfaces, etc.
- **Firebase** - for data storage
- **Styled-Components** - for CSS-in-Javascript
- **Code refactoring**
